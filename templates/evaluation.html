            <p>In the dynamic world of Formula 1 racing, selecting the right tyre compound at the right time can be the difference between standing atop the podium or finishing among the back markers. To aid in this crucial decision-making process, our platform employs a variety of sophisticated neural network models, each with its unique capabilities and applications. Here we provide an evaluation of these models to give you a deeper insight into the technologies that power their race-day decisions.
                <br><br>
                <b>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</b>
                <br>
                ANNs serve as the foundational architecture for our predictive models. These networks mimic the neural structures of the human brain, consisting of nodes and connections that collectively learn to recognize patterns and make predictions. Given their flexibility, they are a solid choice for a broad range of prediction tasks. However, they may not always capture the sequential dependencies that are inherent in time-series data.
                <br><br>
                <b>Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)</b>
                <br>
                LSTMs are a specialized form of RNNs that excel in remembering and utilizing long-term sequential information. They are particularly effective for our application, as the performance of Formula 1 tyres is influenced by a multitude of factors over the race duration. By using LSTMs, our models take into account the progression of the race and the history of tyre performance, resulting in highly accurate predictions.
                <br><br>
                <b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</b>
                <br>
                RNNs are specifically designed for sequential data, making them a natural fit for time-series analysis, such as the progression of a race. They are particularly good at using the immediate past to inform future predictions, which is essential for dynamic and fast-changing race conditions.
                <br><br>
                <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b>
                <br>
                While CNNs are typically associated with image processing, their ability to detect patterns in spatial data can be repurposed for spatial-temporal analysis. Their application in tyre prediction is less conventional but offers interesting possibilities when considering the spatial aspects of tyre wear and track conditions.

            <h2>Input Features</h2>
            <p>
                Our models consider a variety of input features to predict the best tyre compound:
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Race Progress:</b> The current stage of the race is crucial, as tyre wear and required performance characteristics evolve as the race progresses.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Remaining Pit Stops:</b> Planned pit stops can significantly influence the choice of tyre compound at any given point in the race.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Number of Available Compounds:</b> The variety of compounds available during the race affects strategic options and potential outcomes.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Relative Compound Performance:</b> Comparing the performance of different tyre compounds under current race conditions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Location:</b> Track location affects factors like weather, temperature, and track surface, all of which influence tyre performance.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Fulfilled Second Compound Rule:</b> Under F1 regulations, drivers must use at least two different tyre compounds during a race, which must be factored into the strategy.</li>

            <p>The standard LSTM and RNN models showed comparable performance, with the RNN model slightly edging out the LSTM in raw accuracy. However, the CNN lagged in predictive accuracy, likely due to the time-series nature of the data being less compatible with its spatial feature recognition strengths.</p>
            <p>After a hyper-tuning process, the LSTM model showed marked improvement, indicating that the optimization of its parameters led to better model performance.</p>
            <h3>Precision, Recall, and F1 Score Analysis</h3>
            <p>When considering precision and recall, the LSTM model demonstrated a strong balance between these two metrics, as reflected in its F1 score. In contrast, the RNN model had a slightly higher precision but lower recall and F1 score.</p>

            <p>The choice to hyper-tune the LSTM model over the RNN was informed by the LSTM's superior recall and F1 score. In the context of Formula 1, where the cost of false negatives (incorrectly predicting that a tyre compound will perform adequately when it won't) can be as critical as false positives, the balance achieved by the LSTM model is invaluable.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Comparing confusion matrices</h2>
            <p>When comparing confusion matrices for the different neural network models, we are interested in how well each model predicts the correct tyre compound, which in Formula 1 is a critical decision. Let’s break down each model’s performance.</p>
            <h3>ANN</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'fyp/ANN.png' %}" alt="ANN Confusion Matrix" class="confusion">
            <p>True positives for compounds: Hard (207), Medium (849), Soft (3624)
            <br>The model is most accurate for soft tyres, which is beneficial as this compound is often used in the most aggressive racing strategies.
            <br>However, the number of false negatives for hard (221) and medium (619) compounds is relatively high, which could lead to suboptimal tyre strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>LSTM</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'fyp/LSTM.png' %}" alt="LSTM Confusion Matrix" class="confusion">
            <p>True positives for compounds: Hard (300), Medium (983), Soft (3635)
            <br>This model shows an improved prediction for medium compounds compared to the ANN, which can be crucial for race segments where tyre durability and performance are balanced.
            <br>A lower number of false negatives for hard and medium compounds indicates better overall performance than the ANN.
            </p>     
            
            <h3>RNN</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'fyp/RNN.png' %}" alt="RNN Confusion Matrix" class="confusion">
            <p>True positives for compounds: Hard (318), Medium (984), Soft (3611)
            <br>The RNN model provides the highest number of true positives for hard compounds among all models, potentially offering the best strategy for tyre conservation.
            <br>A balanced performance across all compounds, with slightly fewer true positives for soft compounds.
            </p>

            <h3>CNN</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'fyp/CNN.png' %}" alt="CNN Confusion Matrix" class="confusion">
            <p>True positives for compounds: Hard (88), Medium (835), Soft (3647)
            <br>The model performs poorly for hard tyres, which may be problematic in conditions where hard compounds are advantageous.
            <br>Despite the high number of true positives for soft compounds, the higher false negatives for hard and medium tyres could lead to less reliable strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>LSTM Hyper-tuned</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'fyp/LSTM_hyper.png' %}" alt="LSTM Hyper-tuned Matrix" class="confusion">
            <p>True positives for compounds: Hard (329), Medium (998), Soft (3638)
            <br>This model achieves the highest true positives for hard and medium compounds, suggesting an excellent understanding of when these compounds should be selected.
            <br>The hyper-tuned LSTM has fewer false positives and false negatives for hard and medium compounds, indicating a more precise and reliable prediction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box"> 
            <h2>Model Comparsion</h2>
            <p>Upon comparing the confusion matrices, we observe that:
            <br><br>The hyper-tuned LSTM model outperforms the other models in terms of true positives for hard and medium compounds, and it is on par for soft compounds. This model also shows fewer false negatives for hard and medium compounds, suggesting it is the best at not missing opportunities to use these compounds effectively.
            <br><br>The RNN model shows the next best performance for hard compounds, which could make it useful in situations where hard tyres are the optimal choice.
            <br><br>The CNN seems to underperform for hard and medium compounds. Its structure may not capture the sequential time-dependent patterns as effectively as LSTMs and RNNs, which is essential for predicting tyre performance over a race.
            <br><br>The standard LSTM model demonstrates a reliable performance across all tyre types, but its predictions for hard tyres are not as good as those of the hyper-tuned version.
            <br><br>The ANN model, while quite accurate for soft compounds, is less reliable for hard and medium compounds. It lacks the sequential processing advantage that LSTMs and RNNs have, which is likely why it falls short.
            <br><br>In conclusion, the hyper-tuned LSTM model offers the most reliable predictions across all tyre compounds. It has a balanced distribution of predictions, with fewer errors in both false positives and false negatives for hard and medium compounds, which can have a significant impact on race strategy. The LSTM’s ability to remember and leverage long-term dependencies in the data likely contributes to its superior performance.
